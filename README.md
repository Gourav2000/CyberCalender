## File Structure

```
CyberCalender/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calendar.ini          # Main skin configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @Resources/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calendar.lua      # Calendar grid logic and event parsing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Parser.lua        # Reference ICS parser (not used)

```

## Technical Details

### Calendar Logic (Lua)
- **GetDay(index)**: Returns the day number for a calendar cell (0-41)
- **IsInCurrentMonth(index)**: Checks if a date is in the current month
- **IsToday(index)**: Checks if a date is today
- **SetSelectedDate(index)**: Sets the selected date and handles month navigation

### Event Parsing (Lua)
- **parseIcs()**: Parses RFC 5545 ICS format
- **filterEvents()**: Filters events by date
- **convertUtcToIst()**: Converts UTC times to IST with date offset tracking
- **GetParsedResultJson(selectedDate)**: Returns events for a specific date

### Timezone Handling
- Automatically converts UTC times to IST (India Standard Time)
- Handles date changes due to timezone conversion
- Properly filters events by local date after conversion

## Customization

### Colors
Edit the `[Variables]` section in `Calendar.ini`:
```ini
ColorWhite=255,255,255,255
ColorCyan=0,200,255,255
ColorEvent=100,200,255,200
```

### Fonts
```ini
FontFace=Segoe UI Light
FontFaceTitle=Segoe UI
FontFaceDays=Segoe UI
```

### Calendar Position and Size
Edit `[MeterBG]` to change the size and position of the calendar window.
